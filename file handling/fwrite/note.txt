Description:
    The C library function size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) writes data from the array pointed to, by ptr to the given stream.

Declaration:
    Following is the declaration for fwrite() function.
    size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)

Parameters:
    ptr − This is the pointer to the array of elements to be written.
    size − This is the size in bytes of each element to be written.
    nmemb − This is the number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.
    stream − This is the pointer to a FILE object that specifies an output stream.

Return Value:
    This function returns the total number of elements successfully returned as a size_t object, which is an integral data type. If this number differs from the nmemb parameter, it will show an error.
