fseek() returns integer value > 0 if it succesfully sets the stream to the beginning
                              > other value indicates zero

rewind's return type is void.

So we can handle error with fseek but not with rewind.
There is no way to know whether rewind has set the file stream to the beginning.

We should avoid rewind() and use fseek()
