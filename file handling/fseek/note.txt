fseek() is used to move file pointer associated with a given file to a specific position.
Syntax:

int fseek(FILE *pointer, long int offset, int position)
pointer: pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream.
offset: number of bytes to offset from position
position: position from where offset is added.

returns:
zero if successful, or else it returns a non-zero value 

position defines the point with respect to which the file pointer needs to be moved. It has three values:
SEEK_END : It denotes end of the file.
SEEK_SET : It denotes starting of the file.
SEEK_CUR : It denotes file pointerâ€™s current position.
