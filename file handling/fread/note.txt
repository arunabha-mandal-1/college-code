Description:
    The C library function size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream) reads data from the given stream into the array pointed to, by ptr.

Declaration:
    Following is the declaration for fread() function.
    size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)

Parameters:
    ptr − This is the pointer to a block of memory with a minimum size of size*nmemb bytes.
    size − This is the size in bytes of each element to be read.
    nmemb − This is the number of elements, each one with a size of size bytes.
    stream − This is the pointer to a FILE object that specifies an input stream.

Return Value:
    The total number of elements successfully read are returned as a size_t object, which is an integral data type. If this number differs from the nmemb parameter, then either an error had occurred or the End Of File was reached.
