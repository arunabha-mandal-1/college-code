Computer stores structures using the concept of word boundary whose size is machine dependent. In a computer with 2 bytes word boundaries, the members of a structure are stored left-aligned on the word boundary. The character data takes one byte and integer data takes two bytes.*1(this one is kinda vague)
One byte between them is known as slack bytes.

The microprocessors access the data that is present in the even addresses faster than that of the data that is present in the odd addresses.*2
