* C does not permit relational operation on structure variables.
    lets say s1 and s2 are two structures, we cannot do (s1==s1) comparison.
* We can use assignment operator on structure variables.
    like s1=s2 => this one is valid
* We access structure members using member operator(.), more precisely dot operator.
