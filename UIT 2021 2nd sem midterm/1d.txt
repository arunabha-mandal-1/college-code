if-else can evaluate integer, character, boolean, floating-point number on the other hand switch case can evaluate int and char.
when we are checking multiple options using if-else, it becomes kinda slow unlike switch case.
--> so in general if-else is more versatile than switch case --> if-else is better
--> but again when we are checking multiple options associating with int or char, switch case is the better option as it speeds up the program.
